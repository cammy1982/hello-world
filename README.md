# hello-world
This is my first repository ever created on Github. It's a start of a new and exciting journey. 
I really want to learn how to became a software developer. I am really happy that I have found freecodecamp.com. It's a very useful website where I can learn lots of interesting new stuff. I hope I can acomplish this on my own. But perhaps I am going to follow some sort of classical course, because I need to know if I am practising the theory in the right way.
